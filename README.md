Hi friends,

Please see the structure of either the prelab or the report.
I hope the way I organize it is clear to you. Doing it this way will keep things clean and easy to 
keep track. 
Any figure will go into "figs" folder. I suggest naming it with a prefix that contains the tex file it belongs to. 
For example, "intro_laser.png", "result_giant_egg.png". 
The "tex_files" folder is self-explantory.
The "aux" folder is in case you need to include something else like a piece of code or a pdf file, or anything else.
